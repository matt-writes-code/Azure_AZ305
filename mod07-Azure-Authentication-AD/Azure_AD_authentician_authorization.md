# Lab: Managing Azure AD Authentication and Authorization
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

As part of its migration to Azure, Adatum Corporation needs to define its identity strategy. Adatum has a single domain Active Directory forest named adatum.com and owns the corresponding, publicly registered DNS domain. As the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team is exploring the option of transitioning some of the on-premises workloads to Azure, it intends to evaluate integration between its Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment and the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant associated with the target Azure subscription as the core component of its longer-term authentication and authorization model.

The new model should facilitate single sign-on, along with per-application step-up authentication that leverages multi-factor authentication capabilities of Azure AD. To implement single sign-on, the Architecture team plans to deploy Azure AD Connect and configure it for password hash synchronization, resulting in matching user objects in both identity stores. Choosing the optimal authentication method is the first concern for organizations wanting to move to the cloud. Azure AD password hash synchronization is the simplest way to implement single sign-on authentication for on-premises users when accessing Azure AD-integrated resources. This method is also required by some premium Azure AD features, such as Identity Protection.

To implement step-up authentication, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team intends to take advantage of Azure AD Conditional Access policies. Conditional Access policies support enforcement of multi-factor authentication depending on the type of application or resource being accessed. Conditional Access policies are enforced after the first-factor authentication has been completed. Conditional Access can be based on a wide range of factors, including:

- User or group membership. Policies can be targeted to specific users and groups giving administrators fine-grained control over access.
- IP Location information. Organizations can create trusted IP address ranges that can be used when making policy decisions. Administrators can specify entire countries/regions IP ranges to block or allow traffic from.
- Device. Users with devices of specific platforms or marked with a specific state can be used when enforcing Conditional Access policies.
- Application. Users attempting to access specific applications can trigger different Conditional Access policies.
- Real-time and calculated risk detection. Signals integration with Azure AD Identity Protection allows Conditional Access policies to identify risky sign-in behavior. Policies can then force users to perform password changes or multi-factor authentication to reduce their risk level or be blocked from access until an administrator takes manual action.
- Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS). Enables user application access and sessions to be monitored and controlled in real time, increasing visibility and control over access to and activities performed within your cloud environment.

To accomplish these objectives the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team intends to test integration of its Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forest with its Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant and evaluate the conditional access functionality for its pilot users.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment

1. Deploy an Azure VM running an AD DS domain controller by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template


#### Task 1: Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment

1. From your lab computer, start a web browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in by providing credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you will be using in this lab.

1. In the Azure portal, open **Cloud Shell** pane by selecting on the toolbar icon directly to the right of the search textbox.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and select **Create storage**. 

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to identify an available DNS name you will need to provide in the next task (substitute the placeholder `<custom-label>` with any valid DNS hostname which is likely to be globally unique and the placeholder `<Azure region>` with the name of the Azure region into which you want to deploy the Azure VM that will host an Active Directory domain controller):

    ```powershell
    Test-AzDnsAvailability -DomainNameLabel <custom-label> -Location '<location>'
    ```
      > **Note**: To identify Azure regions where you can provision Azure VMs, refer to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/), you can also get the list of the regions using **Powershell cmdlet**
      ```powershell
      Get-AzLocation | FT
      ```

1. Verify that the command returned **True**. If not, rerun the same command with a different value of the `<custom-label>` until the command returns **True**.

1. Record the value of the `<custom-label>` that resulted in the successful outcome. You will need it in the next task.


#### Task 2: Deploy an Azure VM running an AD DS domain controller by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template

1. In the Azure portal, in the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu select **Upload**, and upload the file **\\\\AZ304\\AllFiles\Labs\\10\\azuredeploy30410suba.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource groups (replace the `<Azure region>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region that you specified in the previous task):

   ```powershell
   $location = '<Azure region>'
   ```
   ```powershell
   New-AzSubscriptionDeployment `
     -Location $location `
     -Name az30410subaDeployment `
     -TemplateFile $HOME/azuredeploy30410suba.json `
     -rgLocation $location `
     -rgName 'az30410a-labRG'

1. Configure AD DS in the Azure VM

1. Install Azure AD Connect

1. Configure properties of synchronized user accounts


#### Task 1: Assign a custom domain name to the Azure AD tenant

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Azure Active Directory Adatum Lab | Overview** blade.

1. On the **Adatum Lab \| Overview** blade, select **Custom domain names**.

1. On the **Adatum Lab \| Custom domain names** blade, identify the primary, default DNS domain name associated with the Azure AD tenant. 

    >**Note**: Record the value of the primary DNS name of the Azure AD tenant. You will need it in the next task.

1. On the **adatum.com** blade, review the information necessary to perform verification of the Azure AD domain name and close the blade.

    > **Note**: You will not be able to complete the validation process because you do not own the **adatum.com** DNS domain name. This will *not* prevent you from synchronizing the **adatum.com** Active Directory domain with the Azure AD tenant. You will use for this purpose the default primary DNS name of the Azure AD tenant (the name ending with the **onmicrosoft.com** suffix), which you identified earlier in this task. However, keep in mind that, as a result, the DNS domain name of the Active Directory domain and the DNS name of the Azure AD tenant will differ. This means that Adatum users will need to use different names when signing in to the Active Directory domain and when signing in to Azure AD tenant.


#### Task 2: Configure AD DS in the Azure VM

# Lab 1 - Using the Azure Portal and SQL Server Management Studio

**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

**Pre-requisites: None** 

**Lab files: None**

 

# Lab Overview 

Students will explore the Azure Portal and use it to create an Azure VM with SQL Server 2019 installed. Then they will connect to the virtual machine through Remote Desktop Protocol and restore a database using SQL Server Management Studio. 

# Lab Goal

The student will be able to interact with the Azure portal to create a SQL Server Virtual Machine. They should then be able to connect to the virtual machine and use SQL Server Management Studio to restore a database. 

# Lab Objectives

The students will:

- Interact with the Azure portal

- Create a SQL Server Virtual Machine

- Use SQL Server Management Studio to restore a database

# Scenario

You are a database administrator for AdventureWorks. You need to create a test environment for use in a proof of concept. The proof of concept will use SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine and a backup of the AdventureWorksDW database. You need to set up the Virtual Machine, restore the database, and query it to ensure it is available. 

# Exercise 1: Provision a SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine

**Estimated Time: 20 minutes**

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows: 

1. Explore the Azure Portal and locate important functionality.

2. Create a SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine using the Azure Portal.

 

## Task 1: Explore the Azure Portal

1. From the lab virtual machine, if you are not already in the portal, start a browser session and navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/).

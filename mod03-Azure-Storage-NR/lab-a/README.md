# Lab: Implementing and Configuring Azure Storage File and Blob Services
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario
 
Adatum Corporation hosts large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data in its on-premises storage. Its maintenance becomes increasingly complex and costly. Some of the data is preserved for extensive amount of time to address data retention requirements. The Adatum Enterprise Architecture team is looking for inexpensive alternatives that would support tiered storage, while, at the same time allow for secure access that minimizes the possibility of data exfiltration. While the team is aware of practically unlimited capacity offered by Azure Storage, it is concerned about the usage of account keys, which grant unlimited access to the entire content of the corresponding storage accounts. While keys can be rotated in an orderly manner, such operation needs to be carried out with proper planning. In addition, access keys constitute exclusively an authorization mechanism, which limits the ability to properly audit their usage.

To address these shortcomings, the Architecture team decided to explore the use of shared access signatures. A shared access signature (SAS) provides secure delegated access to resources in a storage account while minimizing the possibility of unintended data exposure. SAS offers granular control over data access, including the ability to limit access to an individual storage object, such as a blob, restricting such access to a custom time window, as well as filtering network access to a designated IP address range. In addition, the Architecture team wants to evaluate the level of integration between Azure Storage and Azure Active Directory, hoping to address its audit requirements. The Architecture team also decided to determine suitability of Azure Files as an alternative to some of its on-premises file shares.

To accomplish these objectives, Adatum Corporation will test a range of authentication and authorization mechanisms for Azure Storage resources, including:

-  Using shared access signatures on the account, container, and object-level

-  Configuring access level for blobs 

-  Implementing Azure Active Directory based authorization

-  Using storage account access keys


## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Implement authorization of Azure Storage blobs by leveraging shared access signatures

-  Implement authorization of Azure Storage blobs by leveraging Azure Active Directory

-  Implement authorization of Azure Storage file shares by leveraging access keys

1. On the **container1** blade, select **Switch to Azure AD User Account**.

1. Note the error message indicating that you no longer have permissions to list data in the blob container. This is expected.

    >**Note**: Despite having the **Owner** role in the subscription, you also need to be assigned either built-in or a custom role that provides access to the blob content of the storage account, such as **Storage Blob Data Owner**, **Storage Blob Data Contributor**, or **Storage Blob Data Reader**.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade of the storage account hosting **container1**, select **Access control (IAM)**, select **+ Add**, and, in the drop-down list, select **Add role assignment**. 

    >**Note**: Write down the name of the storage account. You will need it in the next task.

1. On the **Add role assignment** blade, in the **Role** drop-down list, select **Storage Blob Data Owner**, ensure that the **Assign access to** drop-down list entry is set to **User, group, or service principal**, select both your user account and the user account you created in the previous task from the list displayed below the **Select** text box, and select **Save**.

1. Navigate back to the **container1** blade and verify that you can see the content of the container.


#### Task 3: Upload a file to a blob container by using AzCopy

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az30306a-vm0**, start Windows PowerShell. 

1. From the Windows PowerShell prompt, run the following to download the **azcopy.zip** archive, extract its content, and switch to the location containing **azcopy.exe**:

   $url = 'https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-windows'
   $zipFile = '.\azcopy.zip'

   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Url -OutFile $zipFile

   Expand-Archive -Path $zipFile -DestinationPath '.\'

   Set-Location -Path 'azcopy*'
   ```

1. From the Windows PowerShell prompt, run the following to authenticate AzCopy by using the Azure AD user account you created in the first task of this exercise. 

   ```powershell
   .\azcopy.exe login
   ```

    >**Note**: You cannot use for this purpose a Microsoft account, which is the reason that Azure AD user account had to be created first.

1. Follow instructions provided in the message generated by the command you run in the previous step to authenticate as the **az30306auser1** user account. When prompted for credentials, provide the user principal name of the account you noted in the first task of this exercise and its password **Pa55w.rd1234**.

1. Once you successfully authenticated, from the Windows PowerShell prompt, run the following to create a file you will upload to **container1**:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -Path './az30306bblob.html'

   Set-Content './az30306bblob.html' '<h3>Hello from az30306bblob via Azure AD</h3>'
   ```

1. From the the Windows PowerShell prompt, run the following to upload the newly created file as a blob into **container1** of the Azure Storage account you created in the previous exercise (replace the `<storage_account_name>` placeholder with the value of the storage account you noted in the previous task):

   ```powershell
   .\azcopy cp './az30306bblob.html' 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/container1/az30306bblob.html'
   ```

1. Review the output generated by azcopy and verify that the job completed successfully.

1. From the Windows PowerShell prompt and run the following to verify that you do not have access to the uploaded blob outside of the security context provided by the AzCopy utility (replace the `<storage_account_name>` placeholder with the value of the storage account you noted in the previous task):

   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/container1/az30306bblob.html'
   ```

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az30306a-vm0**, in the browser window, navigate back to **container1**.

1. On the **container1** blade, verify that **az30306bblob.html** appears in the list of blobs.

1. On the **container1** blade, select **Change access level**, set the public access level to **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)** and select **OK**. 

1. Switch back to the Windows PowerShell prompt and re-run the following command to verify that now you can access the uploaded blob anonymously (replace the `<storage_account_name>` placeholder with the value of the storage account you noted in the previous task):

   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/container1/az30306bblob.html'
   ```


### Exercise 3: Implement Azure Files.
